Package: pnn
Title: Probabilistic neural networks
Description: The program pnn implements the algorithm proposed by Specht (1990).
    It is written in the statistical langage R. It solves a common problem in
    automatic learning. Knowing a set of observations described by a vector of
    quantitative variables, we classify them in a given number of groups. Then,
    the algorithm is trained with this datasets and should guess afterwards the
    group of any new observation.  This neural network has the main advantage to
    begin generalization instantaneously even with a small set of known
    observations.
