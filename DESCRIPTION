Package: pnn
Title: Probabilistic neural networks
Description: This program implements the algorithm proposed by Specht (1990).
    It is written in the statistical langage R. It solves a common problem in
    automatic learning. Knowing a set of observations described by a vector of 
    quantitative variables, we classify them in a given number of groups. Then, 
    the algorithm is trained with this datasets and should guess afterwards the 
    group of any new observation.
