Probabilistic neural network (pnn)
==================================

Description
-----------

This program implements the algorithm proposed by Specht (1990). It is written in the statistical langage [R](http://www.r-project.org/). It solves a common problem in automatic learning. Knowing a set of observations described by a vector of quantitative variables, we classify them in a given number of groups. Then, the algorithm is trained with this datasets and should guess afterwards the group of any new observation.
