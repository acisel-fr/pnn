Probabilistic neural network (pnn)
==================================

Description
-----------

This program implements the algorithm proposed by Specht (1990). It is written in the statistical langage [R](http://www.r-project.org/). It solves a common problem in automatic learning: knowing a set of observations described by a vector of quantitativ variables, we classify them and the algorithm should guess the class of a new observation.
