This tutorial shows how to use the library PNN in the statistical software R. We suppose that you already know how to install PNN into R.

### Loading the library and a dataset

First, you have to load the library in R:

```
> library(pnn)
```

Then, load the dataset delivered with the package:

```
> set.seed(1)
> data(norms, package = "pnn")
```

This dataset generates gaussian random points with mean equals to 1 and standard deviation equals to 0.25. Each point has a category attribute A or B. They are centered at (1,1) and (2,2) for category A; centered at (1,2) and (2,1) for category B. The result is a data-frame with 400 rows and 3 columns (category c and coordinates x and y). Let us see what the first ten lines look like.

```
> norms[1:10, ]

   c      x      y
1  A 0.8726 1.1580
2  A 1.4050 1.2477
3  A 0.5281 1.0571
4  A 0.8950 0.6430
5  A 1.1553 1.0348
6  A 0.9433 0.7721
7  A 1.6366 0.8364
8  A 1.0147 0.8765
9  A 1.2126 0.8136
10 A 0.8435 0.7799
```

### Learning phase

We can now create and train a new Probabilistic neural network with this dataset.

```
> pnn <- learn(norms)
```

*pnn* is our main object. It is a list of different parameters:

* *model* stores the name of the model.

```
> pnn$model

[1] "Probabilistic neural network"
```

* *set*, the training set.

```
> pnn$set[1:10, ]

   c      x      y
1  A 0.8726 1.1580
2  A 1.4050 1.2477
3  A 0.5281 1.0571
4  A 0.8950 0.6430
5  A 1.1553 1.0348
6  A 0.9433 0.7721
7  A 1.6366 0.8364
8  A 1.0147 0.8765
9  A 1.2126 0.8136
10 A 0.8435 0.7799
```

* *category.column*, the column index of categories.

```
> pnn$category.column

[1] 1
```

* *categories*, the list of found categories.

```
> pnn$categories

[1] "A" "B"
```

* *k*, the number of variables.

```
> pnn$k

[1] 2
```

* *n*, the number of observations.

```
> pnn$n

[1] 400
```

### Smoothing phase

The neural network needs a smoothing parameter sigma. You can either set it if you have already an idea of its value or let the library search the best value for you. The following code set a known value:

```
> pnn <- smooth(pnn, sigma = 0.72)
```

### Predict phase

Given a new observation, we can now guess the category. The function guess returns a list of two results:

* The category with the highest probability.
* The probabilities of each category.

```
> guess(pnn, c(1, 1))

$category
[1] "A"

$probabilities
     A      B 
0.5758 0.4242 
```

Given a new observation with coordinates (1,1), the neural network gives the most probably category A and the probabilities of each category:
* 0.5758 for category A.
* 0.4242 for category B.

We can now guess the category for other observations.

```
> guess(pnn, c(1.4, 1))

$category
[1] "A"

$probabilities
     A      B 
0.5144 0.4856 

> guess(pnn, c(1.6, 1))

$category
[1] "B"

$probabilities
     A      B 
0.4808 0.5192 

> guess(pnn, c(2, 1))

$category
[1] "B"

$probabilities
     A      B 
0.4161 0.5839
```
